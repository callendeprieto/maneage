Reproduction pipeline for XXXXXXX

For a general introduction to reproducible science as implemented in this
pipeline, please see the link below:

Running the pipeline
====================

1. Necessary dependency: LaTeX.

   Other than LaTeX, this pipeline just needs some basic building tools
   that are already present if you have ever build a software from source
   (Tar, C compiler, and Make). The pipeline will build its own
   dependencies when you run `./configure'.

2. Configure the environment (top-level directories in particular) and
   build all the necessary software for use in the next step. It is
   recommended to modify the directories. Please read the comments (lines
   starting with an `#') in the file that is opened by `./configure' and
   set the directories accordingly.

     $ ./configure

3. Run the following command to reproduce all the analysis and build the
   final `paper.pdf' on 8 threads. If your CPU has a different number of
   threads, change the number.

     $ .local/bin/make -j8

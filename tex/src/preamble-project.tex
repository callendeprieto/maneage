%% Packages you need in your project
%% ---------------------------------
%
%% Here you can add/remove any custom LaTeX package that you need for this
%% project that aren't provided by the journal's style.

% Better than verbatim for displaying typed text.
\usepackage{alltt}

% For arithmetic opertions within LaTeX
\usepackage[nomessages]{fp}

%To add a code font to the text:
\usepackage{courier}

%To add some enumerating styles
\usepackage{enumerate}

%Including images if necessary
\usepackage{graphicx}





%% BibLaTeX or PGFPlots templates
%% ------------------------------
%
%% These are ready-made customizations of these two commonly used packages
%% that you can use as a template for your own project: BibLaTeX (advanced
%% bibliography management) or PGFPlots (for drawing plots within LaTeX
%% directly from tables of data). If you don't use them, you can just
%% delete these two lines and also delete their files from your branch (to
%% keep the 'tex/src' directory on your branch clean).
\input{tex/src/preamble-biblatex.tex}
\input{tex/src/preamble-pgfplots.tex}





%% Style of default paper (DELETE IF USING JOURNAL STYLES)
%% -------------------------------------------------------
%
%% This is primarily defined for the default Maneage paper style. So when
%% you later import your journal's style, delete this line (and these
%% comments). Also delete the file (to keep your project source branch
%% clean from files you don't need/use).
\input{tex/src/preamble-maneage-default-style.tex}

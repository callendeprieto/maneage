%% This is a convenience variable if you are using PGFPlots to build plots

%% not build them with TikZ in LaTeX), then comment the next line. To use
%% PDF files, they have to be in a `tikz' directory. To MAKE PDF files with
%% TikZ and PGFPlots, it is assumed that the texfile containing the source
%% are in a `tex' subdirectory relative to the directory which latex is run

#! /bin/sh

# Running examples:
#
#    $ ./for-group configure
#    $ ./for-group make [-jN]
#
# This is a wrapper for the configure and Make steps designed for a group
# of users (sharing the same group name) using this pipeline on the same
# build directory.
#
# When the configuration (normally done with `./configure') and build
# (normally done with `.local/bin/make') steps are done with this script,
# all the files that are created within the pipeline have these properties:
#
#   1) Group owner will be a special group (value of `thisgroup' below).
#   2) The permission flags give write access to the group members.

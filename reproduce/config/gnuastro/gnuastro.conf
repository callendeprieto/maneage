# Default values for the common options to all the programs in GNU
# Astronomy Utitlies.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE REPRODUCTION PIPELINE: The `lastconfig'
# option is very important here, because we don't want any of
# Gnuastro's programs to go into an un-controlled environment (user or
# system wide configuration files).
#
# The rest of this configuration file in this template reproduction
# pipeline is taken from the default Gnuastro configuration from its
# source (`bin/gnuastro.conf').

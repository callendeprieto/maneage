# Top-level user specific directories. Note the points below:
#
# - The VALUES to these directories are initially JUST PLACE-HOLDERS!
#   Please correct them based on your system.
#
# - The directories don't need to necessarily exist. If they do not exist,
#   they will be created and the necessary data will be downloaded into
#   them. Ofcourse provided that you have write permissions and an internet
#   connection.
#
# - Do not use the tilde expansion `~' or variables for your home
#   directory. Please use the full address, for example
#   `/home/your-user-name'.
#
# - An ending forward-slash `/' is NOT necessary. In the pipeline, all
#   these variables will be followed by a `/', so if you put a `/' at the
#   end of the value here, you will see a `//' in the printed outputs
#   during the processing. This has no technical problem, but can make
#   reading the outputs harder and is thus not recommended.





# Input data
# ----------
#
# This is where the input data (with the same file-name standard as the
# online webpage) are stored. If this directory doesn't exist, or it
# doesn't contain the files (with the correct file-name formats), it will
# be created and the images will be downloaded. See
# `reproduce/config/pipeline/web.mk', for the URLs containing the expected
# inputs for each survey.
SURVEY = reproduce/SURVEY





# Build directory
# ---------------
#
# This is where the intermediate outputs of each step are kept.
#
# Why a separate build directory? So the source and configuration files for
# this reproduction pipeline do not get crowded by all the
# intermediate/derivative files. Also to make synchronization and backups
# more easy: the contents of the build directory do not need to be backed
# up since they can be reproduced and they can be large.
BDIR = reproduce/BDIR





# Memory mapping minimum size
# ---------------------------
#
# Some programs (for example Gnuastro) can deal with cases where the local
# system doesn't have enough memory (RAM) to keep large files there. For
# example, they will create memory-mapped (`mmap' for short) files on the
# HDD or SSD and read/write to them instead of RAM. This will ofcourse,
# slow down the processing, but atleast the program won't crash.
#
# Since the memory requirements of different systems are different and it
# has no effect on the software's final result, the minimum size of an
# allocated array to warrant a mapping to HDD/SSD instead of RAM must also
# be defined here. This value will be used in the programs that support
# this feature.
MINMAPSIZE = 1000000000





# Downloader program
# ------------------
#
# The downloder program (and its output option name) that will be used if
# any of the necessary datasets aren't already available on the
# system. This is usually set at an early stage of the configuration system
# automatically before the file is opened for editing by the user. It is
# thus recommended to not modify it manually.
